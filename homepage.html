    <br>
    <p class="p1">Generally speaking, Madam Nuramira  is a Malaysian entrepreneur and the founder of Kayra products.  She is originally from Kedah and now she is 32 years old. She was raised in a family of commoners.</p>
    </br>
    <br>
    <p class="p1">Even though she was raised in a family of commoners only, it is not an obstacle for her to succeed. Because according to her we cannot give up and all of our hard work will pay off soon if we keep going no matter how hard it gets. So it is clear that she is a woman of perseverance and vision.</p>
    </br>
    <br>
    <p class="p1">In addition, Madam Nuramirah has been very interested in business and entrepreneurship since she was in primary school. This is because since she was ten years old she often helped her mother to sell foods and sell peanut ice creams at her motherâ€™s stall. Then when she was a teenager, she aspired to be a successful entrepreneur and has her own business so that she could change the fate of her family to be richer and happier.</p>
